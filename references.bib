  abstract = "Progress in science relies in part on generating hypotheses with
              existing observations and testing hypotheses with new
              observations. This distinction between postdiction and prediction
              is appreciated conceptually but is not respected in practice.
              Mistaking generation of postdictions with testing of predictions
              reduces the credibility of research findings. However, ordinary
              biases in human reasoning, such as hindsight bias, make it hard
              to avoid this mistake. An effective solution is to define the
              research questions and analysis plan before observing the
              research outcomes-a process called preregistration.
              Preregistration distinguishes analyses and outcomes that result
              from predictions from those that result from postdictions. A
              variety of practical strategies are available to make the best
              possible use of preregistration in circumstances that fall short
              of the ideal application, such as when the data are preexisting.
              Services are now available for preregistration across all
              disciplines, facilitating a rapid increase in the practice.
              Widespread adoption of preregistration will increase
              distinctiveness between hypothesis generation and hypothesis
              testing and will improve the credibility of research findings.",

                     (FAIMS) project and presented during a Round Table session
                     at the 2013 CAA. FAIMS is a major Australian digital
                     infrastructure project established in 2012 to develop open
                     source eResearch tools to improve archaeological data
                     management. We first review existing Android GIS
                     applications and discuss their performance and suitability
                     for archaeological fieldwork in remote locations, before
                     presenting the lessons of this review for FAIMS mobile
                     application development. We then discuss the variety of
                     Australian archaeological practice, suggesting how
                     semantically compatible datasets may be produced from
                     diverse sources at the time of data creation. Finally, we
                     introduce the data structure underlying our mobile
                     application, which accommodates a wide range of practices
                     and data models while promoting syntactic and semantic
                     dataset compatibility.",
